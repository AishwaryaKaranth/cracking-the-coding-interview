Chapter 04 - Problem 07 - Build Order

Problem Statement:
You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects,
where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must
be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built.
If there is no valid build order, return an error.

Solution:
We first represent the projects and build dependencies as vertices and edges in a directed acyclic graph.
We then implement a depth first search based algorithm for topological sorting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms

L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
while there are unmarked nodes do:
    select an unmarked node n
    visit(n)

function visit(node n)
    if n has a permanent mark: // n has already been visited
        return
    if n has a temporary mark: // (not a DAG)
        stop
    mark n temporarily
    for each node m with an edge from n to m:
        visit(m)
    mark n permanently
    add n to head of L

Time complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices in the graph and E is the number of edges.
V can be interpreted as the number of projects and E can be interpreted as the number of dependencies.
Space complexity: O(V)
