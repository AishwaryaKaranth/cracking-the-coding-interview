## CTCI Solutions with Unit Tests
This repository contains my solutions for Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [*Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition*](http://a.co/baneyGe). The #1 rule for this repo is that every solution must have a unit test in `tests.py` using the Python [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html) framework.

### Running the Tests:
In the root directory, execute the following to run all of the tests:
    
    python tests.py

### Contributing
If you find better solutions, please submit a PR. My project for this year is to solve every single problem optimally using Python and C++. So far I have completed chapters 1, 2, and 3 in Python 3.6 with chapters 4 and 5 underway.
