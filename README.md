## Implementations of CTCI Problems

This repository contains my solutions for Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [*Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition*](http://a.co/baneyGe). I wrote and tested these solutions in Python 3.6.

### Running the tests:
We of course practice test driven development :). Every solution must have a unit test in `tests.py`. In the root directory, execute the following to run tests:
    
    python tests.py
