## Implementations of CTCI Problems

This repository contains my solutions for Gayle Laakmann McDowell's [*Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition*](http://a.co/baneyGe). My project for this year is to solve every single problem optimally using Python and C++. So far I have completed chapters 1, 2, and 3 in Python 3.6 with chapters 4 and 5 underway. If you find better solutions, please submit a PR.

### Running the tests:
I of course practice test driven development :). Every solution must have a unit test in `tests.py`. In the root directory, execute the following to run all the tests:
    
    python tests.py
